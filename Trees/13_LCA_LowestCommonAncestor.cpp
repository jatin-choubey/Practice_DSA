/*  LeetCode 236 : Lowest Common Ancestor  https://leetcode.com/problems/lowest-common-ancestor-of-a-binary-tree/description/

Given a binary tree, find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the tree.

According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: â€œThe lowest common ancestor is defined between
two nodes p and q as the lowest node in T that has both p and q as descendants (where we allow a
node to be a descendant of itself).

Input-> p = 4, q = 7
            3
          /  \
        2     5
      /     /  \
    1     4     8
  /           /  \
0            6    9
              \    \
               7    10

ouptput : Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA) = 5

Input-> p = 10, q = 8 (Same Tree as above)
Output = 8 (A node can even be its own ancestor(Not sure how or why, but 'It is What it Is', according to rule))

// Approach 1 : Store the Path from the Root node to the node 'p' and node 'q' respectively. (Exact same we did in previous question No. 12)
/*
for eg : p = 4, q = 7

p_path = [3, 5, 4]
q_path = [3, 5, 8, 6, 7]

Now place one iterator each (say i and j) at the start of both the Path Vectors, and the last element that is found to be the same in both of
the vectors, is our answer.
= 5 in this case.
