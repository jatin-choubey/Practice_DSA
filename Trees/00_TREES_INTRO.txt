                                            BINARY TREE
                                           *************
A Binary Tree is a Non-Linear Tree like data structure, where every parent node can have at max 2 child nodes.


Below are some of the Important types of Binary Trees.

1.  FULL Binary Tree
----------------------
    A full binary tree is the one where each node has either 0 child or 2 children. No node has 1 child.

    eg:             a
                   / \
                  b   c
                 / \ 
                d   e

2.  COMPLETE Binary Tree
--------------------------
    A complete binary tree is a binary tree in which every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled, and all 
    nodes in the last level are filled from left to right.

    eg:             O       Here you see all                                O           Here you see the last level is not
                  /   \     levels are completely                         /   \         filled completely, but are filled 
                 O     O    filled.                                      O     O        from the Left to Right.
               /  \   / \                                               / \    /
              O    O O   O                                             O   O  O 

3.  PERFECT Binary Tree
-------------------------
    A Perfect binary tree is a binary tree in which every level is completely filled.

    eg:             O       Here you see all
                  /   \     levels are completely
                 O     O    filled.
               /  \   / \
              O    O O   O  

4.  BALANCED Binary Tree
---------------------------
    A Balanced Binary Tree is the one whose height is at max 'logN' where 'N' is the number of nodes.
    A height-balanced binary tree is a binary tree in which the depth of the two subtrees of every node never differs by more than one.

    eq:     N = 8
            logN = log8 = 3

            This means if the number of nodes is 8, the height of a Balanced binary tree can not exceed 3.

5.  DEGENERATE Binary Tree
----------------------------

    A Left skewed or a Right skewed Binary Tree is called a Degenerate Binary Tree.

    eq:             O       LEFT SKEWED                                   O     RIGHT SKEWED
                   / \                                                   / \
                  O                                                         O
                 / \                                                       / \ 
                O                                                             O
               / \                                                           / \
              O                                                                 O
