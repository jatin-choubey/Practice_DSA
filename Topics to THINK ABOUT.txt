When you encounter a challenging DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms) coding problem and find yourself 
unable to formulate a suitable algorithm or data structure, consider applying the following techniques. 
Remember, a possible algorithm or approach will often be right in front of your eyes; you just have to figure it out.
You can explore these approaches one by one, starting with those that seem most relevant:

- Prefix Sum
- Suffix Sum
- Binary Search
- Shortest Path Algo
- BFS
- DFS
- Sorting
- Mapping Hash
- Hash Set
- Greedy
- Sliding Window
- Backward Iteration
- Stack
- Monotonic Stack
- Queue
- Monotonic Queue
- Dequeue
- InOrder, PreOrder, PostOrder, LevelOrder
- Adjacency List
- Heap Tree
- Dynamic Programming (Top Down, Bottom Up)
- Recursion + Memoization
- BackTracking
- Class & Struct for custom data type
- Bit Manipulation
